//! The window on Linux: SDL3's, on Wayland or X11, drawn through Vulkan. The window's shell and
//! cursor are SDL's shared ones (`crate::sdl`), and what Linux does its own way is here: SDL runs
//! on the library's UI thread (`ui`), where the window opens, changes and ends, as `sdl` places,
//! sizes and ends it, and its events become the host's input (`input`, `keymap`); each window's
//! render thread draws into its swapchain (`render`). This file is what the shared window code
//! asks of it: what draws into the window ([`FrameSink`]), the window's opening, changes and end,
//! posted to the UI thread, and the host's screens as SDL lists them.
