//! Input capture: whether the guest or the host gets a key, and where the host's pointer may go.
//!
//! A click into the image captures the keyboard and the pointer together: from then on every key
//! goes to the guest, ⌘ shortcuts included (and the host's system keys, which the AppKit side
//! turns off while captured), and the host's pointer is held over the image
//! ([`Capture::pointer_confinement`]): it cannot leave for the title bar or the host's other
//! windows, and every click is the guest's. Nor can the window be resized while captured
//! ([`Capture::window_resizable`]): where the image reaches the window's edges, the pointer held
//! over it is over the window's resize edges too, where a click meant for the guest would drag
//! the window smaller instead, and never larger, the hold keeping the pointer from going
//! outward. The keyboard is never captured without the pointer,
//! nor the pointer without the keyboard. Pressing ⌃⌥⌘ together releases both, and so does the
//! window losing the keyboard. Uncaptured, a key with ⌘ held drives the host's menu and every
//! other key goes to the guest, and the pointer goes where the person moves it.
//!
//! The click that makes the window key only brings it forward: the view does not take a first
//! click (`acceptsFirstMouse:`), so that click neither captures nor reaches the guest. Clicks
//! after it capture, and are sent to the guest.
