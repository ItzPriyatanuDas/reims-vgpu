//! The guest's cursor drawn into a window frame where the window draws it itself, the guest moving
//! it on its own ([`DrawnCursor`], `reims_vgpu_window::handle`'s module doc): the glyph over the
//! frame the display drew, by its alpha, at the guest's cursor position the window last read.
//!
//! The glyph is a second draw in the display's own render pass, after the frame's
//! ([`DisplayCore::encode_current_frame_with`]), so the frame's target is stored once, with no
//! pass that loads it again: the display's strip, a quad over the whole viewport, drawn over a
//! viewport that is the glyph's rectangle in the target, its hot spot at the cursor's position, a
//! glyph pixel to a guest pixel at the image's scale, with a scissor that clips it to the image.
//! It draws with the display's overlay pipeline for the target's format
//! ([`DisplayCore::overlay_pipeline`]): the display's vertex function and
//! `displayPresentFragment`, which samples the glyph as the frame is sampled, filtered where the
//! image scales it, blending over by alpha (`RenderPipelineDesc::blend_over`). The guest's alpha
//! is straight, and the texture holds the glyph premultiplied, so that the filter, where the
//! image scales the glyph, does not darken its edges with the colour of its transparent pixels:
//! at one texel a pixel, each pixel is the glyph's colour over the frame's by its alpha, as with
//! straight alpha. The glyph's colours are drawn as the guest gives them, with no gamma table or
//! colour matrix, as the host's cursor shows them over the image.
//!
//! **What the guest reads.** The draw makes no buffer: it binds the display's. The pipeline is
//! the display's, kept in its cache with its own and made of its functions, so it lives as they
//! do. The glyph's texture is the sink's platform's own ([`OwnTexture`]): on the Vulkan platform
//! one that takes no resource ID and no range of Metal's space, so that no address or ID the
//! guest reads moves for it; on Metal a plain texture, a resource of Metal's like the layer's
//! drawables the window already draws into. The texture is made again only for a new glyph.
//!
//! **Before the frame.** The pipeline and the texture are made before the display encodes the
//! frame ([`CursorPass::prepare`]), from which the frame counts as in flight, which a guest's
//! present waits on. What the platform refuses of them leaves the frame without the guest's
//! cursor, logged once; the host's cursor stays hidden over the image while the guest leads, so
//! neither shows. An encode the platform refuses dies at its send, as the display's own does; the
//! draw's values are ones the platforms take: a scissor inside the target, and a viewport inside
//! the least bounds Vulkan sets every device (the runtime hands a viewport to Vulkan as it is),
//! [`VIEWPORT_BOUNDS`] and [`VIEWPORT_DIMENSION`]; a glyph that would reach past them is not drawn
//! (only near the far edge of a window over 8000 pixels across). Nothing here reaches the guest
//! or the C API: the cursor is in the window's pixels alone.
