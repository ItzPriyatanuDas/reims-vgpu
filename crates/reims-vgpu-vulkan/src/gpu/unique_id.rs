//! The pipeline states made with each resource ID, which decide which state an indirect
//! command's record names ([`crate::gpu::icb`]).
//!
//! A state's `uniqueIdentifier` (SPI, the guest's info command 460) is the runtime's
//! (`ComputePipelineState::unique_identifier`, `RenderPipelineState::unique_identifier`), read
//! as the state is made: one nonzero value for the state's life, no other live state's, and a
//! second state made from an identical record a new one. A state made without
//! `supportIndirectCommandBuffers` answers one of a process-wide count, where Metal's is an
//! address that differs from run to run (`plain-state-unique-identifier`); one made with it
//! answers 2^36 plus an offset in the runtime's allocation of such states, which reuses a
//! released state's identifier, the last released first, by kind, as Metal's does, at offsets
//! that are not Metal's (`unmeasured-unique-identifier`: Metal's follow its allocator and the
//! process's history, as how the process was started). The guest's read of such a state's is
//! relayed as [`crate::answer::Inexact::UniqueIdentifier`], which dies in strict mode
//! (`crate::gpu::resource`'s `guest_identifier`).
//!
//! **By resource ID.** An indirect command's record names its pipeline state by the state's
//! resource ID, and a record the GPU wrote (a kernel's `set_compute_pipeline_state` or
//! `set_render_pipeline_state` of a state it read from an argument buffer, or a blit's copy) names
//! one no setter gave the command. Metal's `getPipelineStateUniqueIdentifier` answers that
//! state's own identifier (measured on the M3 Max, macOS 26.7: of a compute and of a render
//! command a kernel encoded, and of the second of two states made from one descriptor), and still
//! answers it once the state was released, though a state made later took its ID (measured). So
//! each state of a nonzero resource ID, one made with `supportIndirectCommandBuffers`, is kept by
//! that ID and its device with its identifier and the points of [`now`]'s order it was made and
//! released at ([`made`], [`released`], [`holders`]): a state holds its ID from its creation to
//! its release. The runtime gives a state's ID back only once the state goes, so states its plain
//! allocation numbered hold one ID one after another; a state placed at the ID of one still live
//! holds it beside that one. The [`HISTORY`] states made last with each ID are kept. Which of
//! them a record names is decided by when it can have been written ([`crate::gpu::icb`]); the
//! runtime's own answer there (`pipeline_unique_identifier`) names a live holder, and none where
//! a released state's ID was taken while the GPU could write the record.
