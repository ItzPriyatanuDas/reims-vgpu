//! `id<MTLIndirectCommandBuffer>` and its commands: core's `IndirectCommandBuffer`,
//! `IndirectRenderCommand` and `IndirectComputeCommand`, over the runtime's.
//!
//! - **The commands** are the runtime's: each setter writes the command's record, and each
//!   getter reads it back typed (`IndirectCommandBuffer::commands`, the runtime's stand-in for
//!   Metal's private getters), as the records stand now, whoever wrote them. A buffer slot's
//!   getters are the runtime's (`EncodedComputeCommand::kernel_buffer_address` and its kin), past
//!   the 32 slots a record holds too, which the runtime keeps beside the records and its blits
//!   move as Metal's GPU does: the buffer's address plus the offset's low 32 bits, or those bits
//!   alone for nil, and the stride, all ones after a plain set; 0 and 0 for a slot never set or
//!   reset. An execution the GPU replays binds a nil buffer's bits as the address Metal's function
//!   sees, and one replayed on the host binds none and announces `indirect-nil-buffer-offset`,
//!   which dies ([`crate::answer::DIES`]).
//!   A threadgroup memory length's getter is the runtime's too
//!   (`IndirectComputeCommand::threadgroup_memory_length`), past the 31 a record holds as well,
//!   which Metal keeps for its getter alone, as the runtime does: 38 a command, an index of 38 or
//!   more reaching a later command's, as Metal's, which the runtime's blits move with the
//!   records.
//! - **The pipeline state's `uniqueIdentifier`** a command's getter answers is the runtime's
//!   (`pipeline_unique_identifier`): that of the state its record names by the state's resource
//!   ID, which a record the GPU wrote (a kernel's, or a blit's copy) names with no setter's, as
//!   Metal's answers that state's own (measured: a kernel's set of a compute and of a render
//!   state read from an argument buffer); 0 for none, as Metal's. Metal answers the identifier
//!   of the state the record was written with, a released one included, though a state made
//!   later took its ID (measured), and so does the runtime: the state the CPU set, unless the GPU
//!   may have written the record while another state held the ID, and for a record the GPU
//!   wrote, the state that held the ID as the GPU last could write it. Where it cannot tell
//!   which state the record names, it answers none, and the getter dies. The runtime's command
//!   names its state without holding it, as Metal's does: the guest's release gives the ID back,
//!   and a state made later takes it, with the released one's identifier too, as on Metal
//!   (measured), which the command then answers.
//! - **A blit's copy past the destination's end** lands the commands that fit, as Metal's does,
//!   and takes every command before the index as written over ([`IcbObject::overrun`]): Metal
//!   writes over some of those records in its own layout, by a shape this platform does not
//!   follow, and no other buffer changes. A getter, an execution or a copy of one dies until a
//!   reset or a copy writes its whole record again, and so does a `useResource` form that makes
//!   the buffer resident, as a function of the encoder may copy any of its commands
//!   (`copy_command`), where this platform's copy would carry the intact record
//!   ([`IcbObject::resident`]); a copy past the end in a shape nothing measured dies at the
//!   copy (`encode_blit::overrun_measured`).
//! - **Getters Metal reads raw** answer the values Metal's do: a nil patch or control-point index
//!   buffer is Metal's address `0x1eeee1111` ([`NIL_BUFFER_ADDRESS`]), a base vertex is its low 32
//!   bits, zero-extended, every stride of a buffer without dynamic attribute strides is all ones,
//!   and a patch draw's factor scale is 1. Metal reads past the descriptor's buffers and
//!   lengths, which core never asks for; they answer 0 here (a stride all ones without dynamic
//!   attribute strides). Metal's arguments getters
//!   read a record of any kind as their own; core reads each only for a command of its kind, and
//!   another kind's dies here ([`another_kind`]).
//! - **An indexed patch draw of no control-point index buffer** is a patch draw, as Metal records
//!   it (measured: `getCommandType` answers `DrawPatches` and `drawPatchesArguments` its
//!   arguments, whatever the descriptor's types); a nil index or tessellation factor buffer,
//!   which Metal crashes at, dies.
//! - **Numbers the guest sees** are Metal's, the runtime's: the `gpuResourceID`, which is also
//!   the `resourceIndex`, from Metal's pool of IDs of indirect command buffers, and the
//!   `uniqueIdentifier`, Metal's address of the buffer in its range of the GPU's address space
//!   (`rt::IndirectCommandBuffer::unique_identifier`), of a buffer made before the process's
//!   first encoder. Of one made after an encoder of any kind, Metal's address depends on what the
//!   encoders took of the range, which the runtime follows where an M3 Max's take it as fixed,
//!   and the read is relayed, a death in strict mode ([`encoder_made`]).
//!   The runtime's `gpu_resource_id` is the ID a translated kernel encoding through an argument
//!   buffer reaches a buffer's records by, so the kernel reaches the records of the buffer the
//!   guest names. A reservation is the runtime's, as Metal takes, ignores or drops it, to
//!   2^31 - 1, and the runtime makes a buffer at every ID below 2^31 (`RECORDS_ID_LIMIT`), each
//!   ID's records at an address of their own, as Metal makes them; the one Metal spins at, which
//!   the runtime refuses as one, parks the thread holding the lock creations wait on
//!   ([`RESERVING`], [`reserve`], [`new_indirect_command_buffer`]).
//! - **Refusals** die at the selector, naming the runtime's error: Metal without its validation
//!   layer raises at none of them, and goes on at those measured (an index at or past the size,
//!   a command of the other kind, and a Private buffer's command each answer a command object).
