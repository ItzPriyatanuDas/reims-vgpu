//! Core's synchronize and discard of a paged resource on this platform (opcode 62,
//! `SynchronizeAndDiscardResources`), through core's own task, resource and paging code: a
//! private buffer ([`a_discarded_private_buffer_keeps_its_transfer_buffer_until_the_write_back_completed`])
//! and a multisampled `Depth32Float` texture
//! ([`a_discarded_multisampled_texture_keeps_its_transfer_buffer_until_the_write_back_completed`]).
//!
//! `TaskCore::synchronize_resources` encodes the resource's write-back into the paging command
//! buffer: a blit from the private buffer (`copyFromBuffer:toBuffer:`) or the texture
//! (`copyFromTexture:toBuffer:`, every sample) into its transfer buffer, a no-copy buffer over
//! core's mapping of the guest's pages, whose deallocator releases that mapping. It commits the
//! paging command buffer and waits only until it is scheduled; its discard loop then releases the
//! transfer buffer (`PrivateBufferResource::discard`, `PagedTexture::discard`). Core relies on
//! Metal's contract there: a command buffer retains the resources its commands use until it
//! completes, and a no-copy buffer's deallocator runs once the buffer is released, so after the
//! copy completed (Metal's headers; read, not measured here). So the runtime must neither run
//! core's deallocator nor free its import of the transfer buffer's pages, which the keep-alive
//! this platform gives it outlives (`backing::keep_alive`), before the paging command buffer
//! completed: an import freed while the copy is in flight leaves the copy writing through a
//! device address with no memory under it, or one the runtime has handed to a later import.
//!
//! Each case holds the paging command buffer in flight for as long as it looks. Ahead of it on the
//! paging queue, a command buffer of the test's writes the resource's bytes (a copy into the
//! private buffer, a depth clear of the texture), then runs the busy kernel (`spin.metal`, about
//! half a second on the M3 Max at [`ROUNDS`]). A queue's command buffers complete in its order, so
//! the paging command buffer completes after the kernel's, and its copy reads what the work ahead
//! wrote, a tracked hazard. As the synchronize returns, its discard made, the test reads:
//! - whether core's deallocator ran: its mapping leaves the platform's record of core's mappings of
//!   the guest's pages as it is unmapped ([`crate::remap::guest_mappings_of`]);
//! - whether the runtime still holds its import of the pages: its live imports of host memory.
//!
//! It then makes a no-copy buffer of the same length over other guest pages, as the next import
//! after a free would, and once the paging command buffer completed it checks that those pages
//! are untouched, and that the transfer buffer's pages hold the resource's bytes.
