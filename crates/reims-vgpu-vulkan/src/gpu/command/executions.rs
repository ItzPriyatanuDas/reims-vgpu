//! The commands an execution of an indirect command buffer runs, checked at its command buffer's
//! commit where a direct command of their kind dies at its call.
//!
//! - **What is checked.** Two deaths of a direct command depend, for an execution, on the
//!   records of the commands it runs: their draws, and the pipeline states they name. The
//!   runtime runs the records as they stand at the commit (`crate::gpu::icb`), so the commit
//!   reads them (`IndirectCommandBuffer::commands`, of the execution's range, or of every
//!   command where a buffer holds the range) and dies, at `commit`, naming the execution and the
//!   command, where a direct command of its kind dies:
//!   - a draw of points, of some vertices and instances, under a state whose points Metal sizes
//!     none of ([`Points`], `crate::gpu::encode_render`'s `sized`);
//!   - a dispatch or draw under a state that can encode indirect commands, in an encoder that
//!     made resident for writing an indirect command buffer whose ID is not the runtime's
//!     ([`Execution::guest_id`], `crate::gpu::encode_compute`'s `dispatchable`).
//!
//!   Commands that inherit the encoder's state are decided at the execution's call where the
//!   state alone decides (`crate::gpu::encode_compute`, `crate::gpu::encode_render`). A command
//!   of no draw or dispatch, or of a record that names no state, runs nothing, and is not asked;
//!   nor is an execution in an encoder its command buffer's failure runs nothing of
//!   ([`rt::FailedEncoders`]). The state a command runs is the live state of the ID its record
//!   names, where that state's identifier is the one the record answers; else the runtime runs
//!   the state the program set on the command and released since, of which nothing here holds
//!   what decides, and a command a death would ask of dies.
//! - **Records the GPU may write** ([`gpu_writes`]): a blit's copy into a buffer or reset of
//!   it, and a command, direct or executed, whose state can encode indirect commands in an
//!   encoder that made the buffer resident for writing, may write its records as the GPU runs,
//!   and what it wrote may stay. Once the runtime's buffer says so (`gpu_written`, which each
//!   of those sets at its call, as does any encoder's making the buffer resident for writing),
//!   it records an execution committed since once the work before it completed (its host step),
//!   from the records as the GPU and the CPU left them, and so it does an execution whose range
//!   a buffer holds, and a compute encoder's execution under predication. The commit then reads
//!   nothing: an execution that a death could ask of hands the runtime a check at its call
//!   ([`Execution::host_step_check`]), which the host step runs on each command it will record,
//!   before it records any, and which dies there where the commit would have
//!   ([`ask`]). Where the commit reads the records, the runtime records them as the commit read
//!   them and never runs the check. An execution whose own commands may write its records dies
//!   at the commit. A write encoded while a committed command buffer that has not ended executes
//!   the buffer as its commit read it dies at its own call: it may land before those commands
//!   run.
